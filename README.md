# sitelen ilo (sitelen jan pi lawa ilo)
A programming language designed to be used entirely with *sitelen pona*, the constructed script used to write *toki pona*.

This uses the UCSUR encoding of sitelen pona, which will (ale li awen pona la), be replaced by whatever standard encoding Unicode gives it, should that ever happen. This means you'll need to install a UCSUR-compatible sitelen pona font to see it for now.
